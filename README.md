# Word Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains a word generation model implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

# Explanation
In this project, I've developed a word generation model using LSTM networks. The model was trained on a carefully selected dataset, which allowed it to learn patterns and structures present in the text data. The model's performance was tested on my local system, and once satisfied with its results, I decided to deploy it using the Flask framework.

The deployed model allows users to provide an initial word, specify the number of words to generate, and then uses the trained LSTM model to predict and generate the subsequent words. This interactive word generation can lead to creative and coherent text outputs.
